# CodeLab I
CodeLab I - CCO4000-20 Module Materials

## Module Overview

CodeLab I introduces you to the fundamentals of programming. You encounter the first principles of coding from computational thinking and logic through to key programming elements such as variables, conditionals, loops, arrays and functions.

We assume little to no prior experience of coding on entry. You learn programming from the ground up, working through coding challenges and creative briefs that help embed new techniques and best practice into your programming ‘toolkit’.

The covers the following topics

An introduction to the core concepts of programming. You build simple applications that support your understanding of the following topics:
* Algoritmic thinking & logic
* Version control tools
* Data types (int, float, double, boolean, char, string)
* Basic user interactivity
* Operators
* Conditional statements (if, if-else, switch)
* Control flow statements (while, do-while, for)
* Arrays
* Functions (passing in, returning out)

## Repository Contents

### Chapters

These folders breakdown the fundamental programming techniques covered in the module into individual chapters. These chapters should be used in combination with weekly session materials provided on **Minerva** for full information on everything covered through the module. The chapters and content are ordered in line with the classroom content allowing you to follow along before putting what you’ve learned into practice with the exercises.

### Chapter Exercises

Each chapter includes exercises to put into practice the techniques you have learned. You should aim to complete these exercises in order, as without a firm understanding of previously introduced techniques you may struggle to complete the latter more advanced exercises. Exercises with a tickmark included under the heading *Assessment Exercises*  represent exercises that must be submitted as part of the Programming Skills Portfolio assessment as a minimum expectation. The assessment exercises section also contains some bonus exercises which can be completed for higher marks.

You will also find further exercises, which are provided to help you practice and develop your programming skills. Completing these exercises is highly encouraged, although they have **no impact** on the programming skills portfolio mark.

To complete the exercises:

* First make sure you have cloned this repository to your local machine
* Create a **separate project** for each exercise in the corresponsing chapter's exercise folder
* When happy with your solution commit and push your changes back to Github

*Please note that when pushing changes back to Github only the code files will be uploaded, not the Visual Studio / Xcode project files. These have been intentionally ignored by a .gitignore file in the root of the repository to keep Github desktop interface and the GitHub repository clutter free. If you need to access a project on a different machine to the one where the project was originally generated, you may need to create a fresh project and copy in the code from the .cpp file, or create a project from existing code. Guides for doing this are provided in the guides folder.*

### Further Exercises

This folder contains additional exercises that should be used if you are looking for some tougher challenges beyond those included in the chapter exercises.

### Guides

Guides on cloning this repository to your machine via GitHub desktop are provided in the guides folder, alongside general information on creating a project in Visual Studio and Xcode.

### Resources

Useful code snippets for common tasks in C++
